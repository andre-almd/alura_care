# alura_care
My custom code from the project developed in Alura's Machine Learning course.

**This project has the proposal to develop Alura_care, a fictitious startup that aims to reduce the number of tests necessary for the diagnosis of a specific type of cancer.**

This project uses the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29) (Diagnostic) Dataset which features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
